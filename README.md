# TetrisAI
Genetic AI Learning Algorithm applied to Java TETRIS clone.

This project involves a case study between two different archetypes of algorithms: Linear Regression and Neural Networks.

One TetrisAI model will be built from linear regression and the other TetrisAI model will be built from a simple feed-forward Neural Network.

Both models will use the same input parameters and output the same result (the best move to conduct for the current Tetromino)
